         <p>Pixar Animation Studios, commonly known as Pixar , is an American computer animation studio based in Emeryville, California, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios owned by The Walt Disney Company. Pixar began in 1979 as part of the Lucasfilm computer division, known as the Graphics Group, before its spin-off as a corporation on February 3, 1986, with funding from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who became its majority shareholder.[2] Disney purchased Pixar in 2006 at a valuation of $7.4 billion by converting each share of Pixar stock to 2.3 shares of Disney stock,[4][5] a transaction that resulted in Jobs becoming Disney's largest single shareholder at the time. Pixar is best known for its feature films technologically powered by RenderMan, the company's own implementation of the industry-standard RenderMan Interface Specification image-rendering application programming interface. Luxo Jr., a desk lamp from the studio's 1986 short film of the same name, is the studio's mascot.Pixar has produced 23 feature films, beginning with Toy Story (1995), which was the first ever computer-animated feature film; its most recent film was Soul (2020). All of the studio's films have debuted with CinemaScore ratings of at least an "A−", which indicates a positive reception with audiences.The studio has also produced dozens of short films. As of July 2019, its feature films have earned approximately $14 billion at the worldwide box office,[7] with an average worldwide gross of $680 million per film.</p>
